# Code-fun-do-ARS
Project undertaken under Code fun do ++ 2018 by Microsoft
We choose to focus on the management part of the natural disaster given a somewhat fair prediction, both before the disaster strikes and after the disaster affects a region. 
Preparedness plays a crucial role in minimizing the amount of damage to human lives and property.
The disasters we choose to focus on will be specific to our country as of now : 1. Floods and tsunamis, 2. Cyclones, 3. Earthquakes and Landslides.
The login to our app will get all the teams (local authorities, volunteer teams, Army deployed for the rescue effort, etc.) in sync for a better-coordinated approach towards the problem at hand. 

The things we choose to focus for the managing is :
# Before :
''' Preparedness '''
Once we have an idea that a region is affected by a disaster, our application will notify all the users about - all the details and logistics of the disaster (including the government notifications), the nearest shelter accessible and time to reach there via the shortesr route, updates on the current status of the situation using social media posts and media information to give real time information and estimation.

# After :
''' Rescue '''
An SOS message will be notified to the rescue team and nearest safe shelters in case a person is stuck in an emergency and is unable to help themself. When relief workers, government and the public are all better informed, relief efforts may be able to take place much more smoothly and effectively.

''' Predictive focused help '''
Some of the most-actionable information during a crisis comes from citizens, social media users, and on-the-ground aid workers. Images and comments from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube can help experts make initial damage assessments. Social media posts can help relief workers identify and map new disaster sites in need of aid. Other digital content from Twitter, Facebook, and even Youtube can provide early warnings, ground-level location data, and real-time report verification. We will use ML for this. AI can greatly help in collecting accurate data and provide information about real time landscapes and damaged buildings.

''' Manage drives '''
For the volunteer groups, we first categorise them for specific tasks, manage the collection drives and track resource allocation. Dashboard view that displays Proximity data â€“ which team (volunteers, local authorities, Army or Navy deployed for rescue effort) is near to an area where people are stranded and/or need help. Guide those teams to that location & suggested an optimal route to take. Measure what worked and what did not.
